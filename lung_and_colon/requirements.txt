# Recommended PyTorch builds targeting CUDA 12.8 (cu128).
# We keep the PyTorch cu128 wheel index above. Do NOT include the +cu128
# suffix in the package name here so pip can resolve a matching +cu128 wheel
# from the PyTorch index. If you want a reproducible install, uncomment and
# adjust the pinned examples below to a known available +cu128 build.
